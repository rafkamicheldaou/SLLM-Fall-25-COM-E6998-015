**Scaling Large Language Models (Fall 2025)**  
This repository houses all **code examples, notebooks, and resources** for the Columbia University seminar on **Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

---

## Course Overview
This seminar explores **frontier research** in scaling, optimizing, and deploying large language models (LLMs) through a structured progression from **foundations** to **futures**.  
The course emphasizes **hardware–software co-design** as the key to advancing efficiency and capability.

### Topics Covered
- **Foundations**
  - Scaling laws for LLMs
  - Distributed training
  - Attention mechanisms, including **Mamba** and **Bamba**
- **Inference Scaling**
  - Serving systems, decoding, quantization
  - KV-cache compression
  - Mixture-of-Experts
- **Agentic AI**
  - Reasoning and tool-using systems
  - Self-improving LLMs
- **Hardware Futures**
  - Analog accelerators
  - Memory-offload approaches
  - Neuromorphic architectures (e.g., **IBM NorthPole**)

Students will engage with top-tier conference papers (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ISCA, ACL), present and critique readings, and complete a semester-long **group project**, resulting in a **survey paper with experimental evaluation**.

##  Repository Structure
The repository is organized by week. Each week’s directory contains relevant **code examples, notebooks, and reading resources**.


- Some weeks contain **Colab notebooks** with an "Open in Colab" badge for interactive learning.
- Other weeks may include **links to external resources** or open-source repositories.
